Brute-Force Authentication — Credential Disclosure
Vulnerability:

The target application does not provide adequate protections against automated password guessing (brute-force / credential stuffing). A valid account was obtained through repeated automated attempts.

Weaknesses:

No effective account lockout or rate-limiting mechanisms.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not implemented.

Weak or easily guessable passwords are accepted.

Insufficient monitoring and alerting for repeated failed login attempts.

Authentication relies solely on username/password without additional protections.

Exploitation (non-actionable summary):

Automated attempts were performed against the login endpoint using a username list and password wordlist.

A successful credential pair was identified and used to authenticate.

Upon successful login, the application issued a session (cookie/token) which allowed access to protected functionality.

No step-by-step exploit commands are included here to avoid enabling misuse.

Flag / Evidence:

Place the extracted flag or redacted evidence here (e.g. FLAG{REDACTED}) or keep it in the flag file.

Do not include sensitive credentials in shared versions of this report.

PoC / Logs (sanitized):

Provide high-level logs or sanitized proof (timestamped events, HTTP status codes, counts of attempts).

Example (sanitized):

2025-10-02 21:45:23 — 125 attempts from scanner -> 1 successful login (user: [redacted])

Avoid raw requests or passwords in public/shared reports.

Impact:

Unauthorized account access, potential data exposure, and further lateral actions within the application.

Depending on the account privileges, impact may range from user data disclosure to administrative compromise.

How to Fix:

Implement strict rate limiting and progressive exponential backoff for failed login attempts.

Enforce account lockout or temporary suspension after a configurable number of failed attempts.

Require strong password policies and reject commonly used passwords (use a denylist like rockyou entries).

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts and highly sensitive actions.

Use CAPTCHAs or challenge-response on suspicious login flows (with care to accessibility).

Monitor and alert on unusual authentication patterns (high failure rates, bursts of attempts, distributed sources).

Log authentication attempts with sufficient detail for investigation (but never log plaintext passwords).

Recommendations for Incident Handling:

Immediately rotate credentials for the compromised account(s).

Invalidate active sessions for affected accounts and require re-authentication.

Review access logs for suspicious activity following the compromise and export logs for forensic analysis.

If applicable, notify affected users and stakeholders according to your incident response policy.
